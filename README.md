## A Book Searching App with Infinite Loading with React

I used create-react-app to build this, this is a simple react app that can help to search books with required Key word. this was built with infinite loading so new names load after completion of reading the old names and reaching end.

this app is not responsive, i just built this as practise while learning infinite loading with react from "Web Dev Simplified".

this not copied code, i just followed his instructions and added a few styles by the end of the project to give it an interactive UI.
